to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

Police Officers responded to the 4200 block of South Eddy St. to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

Police Officers responded to the 4200 block of South Eddy St. to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

Police Officers responded to the 4200 block of South Eddy St. to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

Police Officers responded to the 4200 block of South Eddy St. to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

Police Officers responded to the 4200 block of South Eddy St. to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

Police Officers responded to the 4200 block of South Eddy St. to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

Police Officers responded to the 4200 block of South Eddy St. to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

Police Officers responded to the 4200 block of South Eddy St. to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

Police Officers responded to the 4200 block of South Eddy St. to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

Police Officers responded to the 4200 block of South Eddy St. to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

Police Officers responded to the 4200 block of South Eddy St. to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

Police Officers responded to the 4200 block of South Eddy St. to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

Police Officers responded to the 4200 block of South Eddy St. to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

Police Officers responded to the 4200 block of South Eddy St. to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

Police Officers responded to the 4200 block of South Eddy St. to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

Police Officers responded to the 4200 block of South Eddy St. to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

Police Officers responded to the 4200 block of South Eddy St. to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",

Police Officers responded to the 4200 block of South Eddy St. to investigate a domestic violence report. While talking to a male subject associated with the call, officers heard gunshots coming from the street near where two vehicles were approaching them. The officers took up defensive positions and returned fire. One vehicle fled the area. The occupants of the other vehicle were detained and searched. No weapons were found. A .45 caliber handgun was located some distance down the street and is believed to have been thrown from the second car as it fled.   \n",
